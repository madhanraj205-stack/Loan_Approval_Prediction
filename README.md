# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Title

**Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning**

## 🧩 Project Description

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and other relevant features. The system helps banks and financial institutions automate the loan approval process and reduce manual effort.

The project is implemented using Python and runs in **Google Colab**. It includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready steps.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**

   * Collect dataset from Kaggle or public sources
   * Store in CSV format

2. **Data Analysis**

   * Understand data distribution
   * Identify missing values and outliers

3. **Idea Generation & SRS Implementation**

   * Define problem statement
   * List functional and non-functional requirements

4. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handle missing values
   * Encode categorical features
   * Feature scaling

5. **Select ML Algorithm**

   * Logistic Regression
   * Decision Tree
   * Random Forest

6. **Train the Model**

   * Split data into train and test sets
   * Train selected ML model

7. **Test the Model**

   * Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

8. **Make Predictions**

   * Predict loan approval for new applicants

9. **Deployment (GitHub)**

   * Push code, dataset, and README to GitHub
   * (Optional) Create a simple web app using Streamlit or Flask
